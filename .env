DESCRIPTION = "\nThis tool provides a **fast and automated** way for interactively converting XML data to RDF Turtle data. Alternative approaches require manual mappings between the XML and RDF data, which is time-consuming and error-prone. In contrast, this tool uses the corresponding DTD file to automatically generate the RDF data. However, please note that that due to the nature of implemented approach, our automated process has no capabilities for changing structure of the generated RDF data. Instead, the generated RDF data is a direct representation of the XML data.\n\nPlease see our [GitHub repository](%s) for more information and how to deploy the tool locally. This tool is a frontend for the [XML2RDF](https://github.com/WSE-research/DTD2RDFConverter) converter which is provided as a web service.\n\nPlease use the file drop zones to upload a <acronym title="Document Type Definition">DTD</acronym> file (defining the XML structure and types) and one or more corresponding XML files.\n\nUse the sidebar to configure the language tag for string literals in the XML files and the prefix for the generated URIs of the RDF file. It is also possible to configure the layout of the application in the sidebar. There, examples (DTD and XML files) are available as well. "
